# H5P
Demo on how to use H5P tools as stand alone.

H5P are interative tools that enhance and facilitate considerably learning concepts. While the tools are open source, they still require a server to host the app, in addition to wordpress capability. This prevents their use for fully autonomous pages, for instance like those hosted in Github.

There is a [code] (https://github.com/tunapanda/h5p-standalone) developed to make H5P stand alone, but it lacks instructions on how to use it. A good [video exist] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvQIljCP-m4), but it is out of date.

Here we provide a working example on how to turn H5P tools fully automonous in Github. Credit to the creators of the [code] (https://github.com/tunapanda/h5p-standalone) and to [Daisuke Horita] (https://github.com/CleanLake412) for working on the implementation.
