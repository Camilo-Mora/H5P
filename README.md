# STANDALONE H5P
[Demo](https://camilo-mora.github.io/H5P/) on how to use H5P tools as stand alone.

H5P are interative tools that enhance and facilitate considerably learning concepts. While the tools are open source, they still require a server to host the app, in addition to wordpress capability. This prevents their use for fully autonomous pages, for instance like those hosted in Github.

There is a [code](https://github.com/tunapanda/h5p-standalone) developed to make H5P stand alone, but it lacks instructions on how to use it. A good [video exist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvQIljCP-m4), but it is out of date.

Here we provide a working example on how to turn H5P tools fully automonous in Github. Credit to the creators of the [code](https://github.com/tunapanda/h5p-standalone) and to [Daisuke Horita](https://github.com/CleanLake412) for working on the implementation.

Step 1. Copy all the files in this repository in your own.

Step 2. Take your H5P file and change the extension from .h5p to .rar

For instance: 08_experiment-8.h5p  should be renamed to 08_experiment-8.rar

Step 3. use any available siftware and unzip the rar file.

Step 4. Place all the full unzipped folder inside the H5P folder in the repository (note the H5P folder in this repository. in there is where your own unzipped h5p should be located.).

Step 5. In your HTML code, add the following code in the position where you want the H5P tool.


```html
<div id="h5p-container-8"></div> // YOUR H5P FILE (THIS IS A FOLDER PATH)
<script>
  (function() {
    let h5pContainer = document.getElementById("h5p-container-8"); // div tag ID
    let h5pJsonPath = 'H5P/08_experiment-8'; // YOUR H5P FILE (THIS IS A FOLDER PATH)

    if (!document.getElementById('h5p-bundle-js')) {
      let script = document.createElement('script');
      script.id = 'h5p-bundle-js';
      script.src = 'libs/h5p/main.bundle.js';
      h5pContainer.parentNode.insertBefore(script, h5pContainer.nextSibling);
    }

    window.addEventListener("load", function() {
      const options = {
        h5pJsonPath: h5pJsonPath,
        frameJs: 'libs/h5p/frame.bundle.js',
        frameCss: 'libs/h5p/styles/h5p.css',
      }
      new H5PStandalone.H5P(h5pContainer, options);
    });
  }) ();
</script>

```

Step 6. In the code above replace the names of the H5P files for yours..
