# H5P
A demo of how to use H5P tools as stand alone.

H5P are interative tools that enhance and facilitate considerably learning concepts. While the tools are open source, they still require a server to host the app, in addition to wordpress capability. This prevents their use for fully autonomous pages, for instance like those hsoted in Github.

There is a code [https://github.com/tunapanda/h5p-standalone] developed to make H5P stand alone, but it lacks instructions on how to use it.

Here is the stand-alone code. and here I found a video of how to do it in an earlier version of the code. Here are my .h5p files.

the idea is for those exercises to be hosted and displayed in github.
